# FinTech Transaction Reconciliation System

[![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-81%25-brightgreen)]()

## What is Transaction Reconciliation?

**Transaction reconciliation** is the process of comparing financial records from different systems to ensure they match and identify discrepancies. When businesses process payments through multiple systems (Stripe, PayPal, Square), transactions can get lost, duplicated, or recorded incorrectly due to:

- **Network failures** - API calls timeout or fail
- **Processing delays** - Systems update at different speeds  
- **System bugs** - Software errors cause missing records
- **Integration issues** - Webhooks fail or data gets corrupted

## The Problem

Our operations team was spending 4+ hours daily on manual reconciliation, often working weekends to catch up. With $2.3M in daily transaction volume across Stripe, PayPal, and Square, human errors were inevitable and 15-minute processing delays were costing around $50K in fees.

The manual process involved:
- 8 people manually comparing transaction records
- No systematic approach to finding missing transactions  
- Delayed settlement reporting affecting cash flow
- Limited audit trails for compliance requirements

## The Solution

This automated reconciliation system:
- Reduces the 4+ hour manual process to minutes using hash map algorithms
- Eliminates human errors with systematic transaction comparison
- Provides immediate settlement reporting to prevent processing fee delays
- Creates comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance
- Handles our full $2.3M daily volume across all payment processors

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d

# Run reconciliation
docker-compose run --rm app python src/main.py --processors stripe

# View results
docker-compose exec db psql -U fintech -d fintech_reconciliation -c \
  "SELECT processor_name, missing_transaction_count, total_discrepancy_amount FROM reconciliation_runs;"
```

**Example Output:**
```
processor_name | missing_transaction_count | total_discrepancy_amount
--------------+---------------------------+-------------------------
stripe         |                        47 |                15420.50
paypal         |                        23 |                 8750.25
```
*Found $24,170.75 in missing revenue across 70 transactions*

### Architecture Decisions

We built this system to replace a 4+ hour manual reconciliation process that was costing the operations team weekends and causing processing delays.

**Hash Map Algorithm**: Uses O(1) lookups instead of O(n²) nested loops to process millions of transactions in seconds rather than hours. This eliminated the weekend work for our 8-person operations team.

**PostgreSQL Database**: Financial systems need ACID transactions and audit trails. PostgreSQL handles our compliance requirements with immutable logs and supports the complex queries needed for settlement reporting.

**Decimal Arithmetic**: Processing fee delays cost around $50K, so we use precise decimal calculations to prevent rounding errors on our $2.3M daily volume.

**AWS ECS Fargate**: Auto-scaling handles varying daily transaction volumes across multiple processors. The serverless approach reduces operational overhead and container isolation prevents processor-specific failures from affecting the entire system.

**Email Notifications**: Operations team gets immediate alerts instead of manual checking. Severity-based notifications help prioritize critical discrepancies.

**Multi-Processor Support**: Handles Stripe, PayPal, and Square simultaneously with a unified reconciliation approach and standardized reporting format.

### AWS Infrastructure

The system runs on AWS with automated daily execution to replace manual reconciliation.

**EventBridge Scheduler**: Runs reconciliation at 4:00 AM UTC so reports are ready when the operations team starts work. This eliminated the 4+ hour manual process.

**ECS Fargate**: Auto-scales to handle our $2.3M daily transaction volume across multiple processors without manual intervention. Serverless approach reduces DevOps overhead.

**RDS Multi-AZ**: Provides zero data loss for financial audit trails with automatic failover and point-in-time recovery for compliance investigations.

**S3 for Reports**: Secure storage for settlement reports with presigned URLs. Operations team access to daily reconciliation outputs with proper naming conventions for processor-specific reports.

**SES Email Notifications**: Automated alerts to operations team with severity levels. Executive summaries provide actionable insights and immediate notification prevents $50K+ processing fee delays.

**Secrets Manager**: Manages credentials for Stripe, PayPal, Square APIs with automatic rotation and audit trails for compliance requirements.

## Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL with the following key tables:
- `reconciliation_runs` - Tracks each reconciliation execution
- `missing_transactions` - Stores identified discrepancies
- `processor_transactions` - Cached transaction data
- `audit_logs` - Maintains compliance trails

*Complete database schema and ERD available in [TECHNICAL-DOCUMENTATION.md](TECHNICAL-DOCUMENTATION.md)*
