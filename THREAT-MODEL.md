# Security Threat Analysis - FinTech Reconciliation System

## Overview

This document analyzes potential security threats to our financial reconciliation system. Since we handle sensitive transaction data, we need strong security measures to prevent data breaches, fraud, and compliance violations.

**System Risk Level**: HIGH (processes financial data)
**Regulatory Requirements**: PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15

## What We're Protecting

### Critical Data and Systems
- **Payment Data**: Transaction records from Stripe, PayPal, and Square
- **Company Records**: Internal transaction database
- **Reports**: Financial discrepancy analysis and audit logs
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS services (containers, database, storage)
- **Access Credentials**: Database passwords and API keys

### Security Boundaries
1. **Internet to Cloud**: External connections entering our AWS environment
2. **Public to Private Networks**: Application containers accessing the database
3. **External API Calls**: Connections to payment processor systems
4. **File Storage**: Report uploads and downloads from S3
5. **Email Delivery**: Sending notifications to operations team

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Insider Threat - Malicious Employee
**Attack Path:**
1. Employee with AWS access downloads transaction data
2. Modifies reconciliation reports to hide discrepancies
3. Covers tracks by deleting audit logs

**Impact:** Financial fraud, regulatory violations, data breach
**Mitigations:**
- Immutable audit logs (cannot be deleted after 1 minute)
- Row-level security preventing unauthorized data access
- CloudWatch logs stored separately from application
- Regular access reviews and principle of least privilege

### Scenario 2: External Attacker - Credential Compromise
